# Intelligent Tutoring System

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in Java. An ITS is a software system that provides personalized instruction or tutoring to students based on their individual needs and learning progress.

## Components

1. **User Interface**: Provides an interface for users (students) to interact with the system and access learning materials.
2. **Content Delivery**: Delivers educational content such as lessons, quizzes, and exercises to students.
3. **Student Modeling**: Tracks and models individual student progress, learning styles, and knowledge levels.
4. **Adaptive Feedback**: Generates personalized feedback and recommendations for students based on their performance and learning goals.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class to start the Intelligent Tutoring System.
2. Use the user interface to navigate through available lessons, quizzes, and exercises.
3. Interact with the system to receive personalized instruction and feedback based on your performance and learning progress.

## Example

```java
// Initialize components
UserInterface ui = new UserInterface();
ContentDelivery contentDelivery = new ContentDelivery();
StudentModeling studentModeling = new StudentModeling();
AdaptiveFeedback adaptiveFeedback = new AdaptiveFeedback();

// Retrieve lesson content
String lesson = contentDelivery.getLesson("Java Programming");
System.out.println("Lesson content: " + lesson);

// Simulate quiz score
int quizScore = 75;
studentModeling.updateStudentModel("student123", "Java Programming", quizScore);

// Provide adaptive feedback
String feedback = adaptiveFeedback.generateFeedback(quizScore);
System.out.println("Feedback: " + feedback);

```
